First things first - we're going to need you to turn in your preconceived notions on college, career, and money. </p><h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h3><p>Why, I'm Major Payoff of course. As a sworn PayOfficer, it's my duty to train the next generation to navigate the no-mans land of adulthood. Together, we'll drill tactics to dodge debt and despair, navigate alternative career pathways, and march on the promised land of job offers and promotions.</p><p>I'm going to teach you to think about money in a completely new way that will motivate you to break free of the shackles of societal expectations and live life on <strong>your terms</strong>. </p><p>To break your chains of bondage, you'll learn just how bad of a deal student loans are, which majors have a real payoff, and why dropping out may not be such a bad idea.</p><p>Once you've broken free, you'll see clearly just how much of a sham the traditional track is, and experience first-hand the superior career paths and lifestyle benefits that have laid before you the entire time. Low debt, plentiful free time, and early retirement will be just a handful of the benefits provided. </p><p>This probably sounds too good to be true. You might be thinking to yourself...</p><blockquote><strong>"Major, don't you realize that any job worth having requires a bachelors AT MINIMUM?"</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>"All of my friends are going to college! I don't want to be the only one left still living at home while everyone's partying it up!"</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>"But Major, I don't have the money to go to college. Student loans are the only way I can attend! What's wrong with that?"</strong></blockquote><p>All of these questions and concerns, and many more, will be addressed as we journey together in our mission to get a major payoff.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
